## Anti-virus flags ni as a malware - what should I do?

Major Anti-viruses will recognize ni as a malware. However that is because ni comes with injector. This is a false positive and it's safe to put ni on exclusion list.

## One of the existing profiles doesn't work - what should I do?

Best option would be to contact the profile creator directly. They will usually hang out on ni's [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/xBFKJc6QRr).

## How to reload profiles while the game is running?

You can reload the profiles by running one of these slashs commands:

```lua
/reload ui
/reload
/rl
```
