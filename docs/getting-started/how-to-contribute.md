## Impementing new core features

We are trying to constatly add new features to ni, and having extra pair of hands would help.

## Creating and sharing profiles

Although it is possible convert old PQR profiles, we feel like PQR was fairly limited and as such those profiles are not utilizing ni's full potential.

Therefore we are strongly advising everyone to create profiles specficially designed for ni.

> Take a look at our **Profiles** section to see what is missing.

## Ni Documentation & API Reference

See an issue with the documentation? Good news! It is very easy to contribute. The [Ni Website](https://nhub.app/) is generated from Markdown files using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/).

If you are a developer you can follow the standard pull request process.

> If you are not a developer you can use the new Edit on Github link at the top of each page.
